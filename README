Revision: 1.0																				
PLEASE NOTE
Currently, this has been tested to compile with the C18 compiler, and has been tested
with version 3.40 of the C18 compiler.  It will not compile under XC8.  I plan to re-write the code for the newer XC9 compilerâ€¦someday.

RGB Lantern Project

The RGB Lantern Project is designed to read in sensor inputs and then change the output of the BlinkM
module accordingly.  The BlinkM module was choosen as it also contains additional pre-programmed modes
that can easily be accessed using the I2C bus.  In addition, it is very possible to chain multiple 
BlinkM modules for added effects as well.  The premise of the project is to have this as an outdoor
lantern that will read in temperature, humidity and pressure data.  The RGB LEDs can then respond to these
sensors accordingly.  In addition to sending this information by color information, an xBee module was
also included to give data via the 18F2520 UART.  A simple ASCII menu system was also developed so the user
can change modes of the lantern in addition to obtaining data from the sensors
